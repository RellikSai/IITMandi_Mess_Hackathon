# 🏫 Smart Campus AI • IIT Mandi

**Smart Campus AI** is an integrated, AI-powered campus intelligence platform designed to enhance **food sustainability**, **hostel operations**, and **student experience** within a university environment.  
Built using **Streamlit** and **Machine Learning**, the platform showcases how data-driven decision-making can reduce food waste, improve administrative efficiency, and encourage responsible student behavior through **gamification**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reduce food wastage through accurate demand forecasting  
- Improve mess and hostel administration efficiency  
- Encourage sustainable student behavior using gamification  
- Streamline campus complaint management with intelligent prioritization

## 🧠 Core Modules

### 🍽️ Food Demand Prediction System
This module helps mess administrators predict the number of students likely to attend upcoming meals.

**Key Features:**
- Uses historical attendance data
- Considers contextual factors:
  - Day of the week
  - Meal type
  - Holidays
  - Weather conditions
  - Exam schedules
  - Previous attendance trends
- Trained using a **Random Forest Regression model**

**Impact:**
- Optimized food preparation
- Significant reduction in overproduction and food waste
- Maintains food availability and service quality

---

### ♻️ WasteLess League (Gamified Sustainability Module)
A gamified system that motivates hostels to actively reduce food waste by turning sustainability into a friendly competition.

**How It Works:**
- Daily food waste data is tracked per mess
- Mess are assigned badges (prestigious positions-like)
- Visual progress indicators and leaderboard-style comparisons

**Behavioral Nudges:**
- Smart tips and “cheat-code” style hints
- Encourages students to take only what they need
- Reinforces positive behavior through recognition, not enforcement

---

### 🛠️ Complaints Organizer
A centralized system for managing campus complaints efficiently.

**For Students:**
- Submit complaints related to:
  - Water
  - Electricity
  - Cleanliness
  - Other infrastructure issues
- Set a tolerance period for resolution

**For Staff:**
- Automatic complaint classification
- Priority-based sorting and dashboards
- Categorized views for faster resolution

**Benefits:**
- Reduced response time
- Better organization
- Improved campus living experience
